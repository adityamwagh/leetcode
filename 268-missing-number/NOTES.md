* **Approach 1**  XOR the elements of given array with a [0...n] array. That way, equal elements will cancel out, giving us the missing element in given array.
**Time Complexity: O(n), Space Complexity: O(n)**
â€‹
* **Approach 2** Use maths, sequences and series. n * (n + 1) / 2 -  sum()given array)
* **Approach 3** Store 0...n in hash map, and then compare with the array elements.
